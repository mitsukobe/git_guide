Step one: Set configuration options
- git config -- list : summarizes configuration options
- user.name
- user.email
- core.editor 

user.email=dimitra.bernidaki@ln2db.com
user.name=dimitra bernidaki
core.editor='C:/Program Files (x86)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -nosession

Step two: initialize repository
- cd ...\mygitrepository_whateva
- git init

Step three: add files to staging area
-	git status
-	git add 

It turns out that Git stages a file exactly as it is when you run the git add command. 
If you commit now, the version of CONTRIBUTING.md as it was when you last ran the git 
add command is how it will go into the commit, not the version of the file as it looks 
in your working directory when you run git commit. If you modify a file after you run 
git add, you have to run git add again to stage the latest version of the file.
